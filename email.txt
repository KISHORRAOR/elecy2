We've updated our terms and conditions

Due to the nature of the changes, we require you to review them, or your account will remain suspended.
Review the new T&Cs: http://revolut-verify.example.com/review

Hi John,

We’ve made some important updates to our Terms and Conditions, including support for transactions in over a dozen new countries. To comply with regulatory requirements, all users must review and accept the updated terms before continuing to use their accounts.

What you need to do:

Please review and accept the new Terms and Conditions by 16 Nov 2025.

Until you do:

    Your account will remain temporarily suspended
    Any funds tied to the account will be unavailable

Why is this happening?

It's not just your account.

As we expand internationally, we’re required to meet local regulatory and financial compliance obligations. That includes updating our terms and getting explicit user agreement before we can continue providing services in certain regions. These requirements come from banking partners, regulators, and international compliance frameworks—and unfortunately, we can’t make exceptions.


Until each user has accepted the updated terms, we’re not legally able to allow account access or release funds.
